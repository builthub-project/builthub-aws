SIEC is intended to be a multipurpose classification, meaning that individual SIEC products and aggregates are defined to be suitable for the production of energy statistics under different country circumstances and are relevant for the presentation and analysis of energy data in various policy and analytical contexts. In this connection, it is recognized that SIEC should be periodically reviewed and revised as necessary to reflect changes in the patterns of energy production and consumption."@en ;
